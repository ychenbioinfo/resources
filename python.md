* Miserlou/Zappa https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa

  Zappa makes it super easy to build and deploy server-less, event-driven Python applications (including, but not limited to, WSGI web apps) on AWS Lambda + API Gateway. Think of it as "serverless" web hosting for your Python apps. That means infinite scaling, zero downtime, zero maintenance - and at a fraction of the cost of your current deployments!
  
* Steamlit https://streamlit.io/

  Streamlit is the first app framework specifically for Machine Learning and Data Science teams. So you can stop spending time on frontend development and get back to what you do best.

* Reflow https://github.com/grailbio/reflow

  Reflow is a system for incremental data processing in the cloud. Reflow enables scientists and engineers to compose existing tools (packaged in Docker images) using ordinary programming constructs. Reflow then evaluates these programs in a cloud environment, transparently parallelizing work and memoizing results. Reflow was created at GRAIL to manage our NGS (next generation sequencing) bioinformatics workloads on AWS, but has also been used for many other applications, including model training and ad-hoc data analyses.
