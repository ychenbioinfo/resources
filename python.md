  Zappa makes it super easy to build and deploy server-less, event-driven Python applications (including, but not limited to, WSGI web apps) on AWS Lambda + API Gateway. Think of it as "serverless" web hosting for your Python apps. That means infinite scaling, zero downtime, zero maintenance - and at a fraction of the cost of your current deployments!

  Streamlit is the first app framework specifically for Machine Learning and Data Science teams. So you can stop spending time on frontend development and get back to what you do best.
