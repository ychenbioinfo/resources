- Computational Statisics in Python (Duke University) [STA 663](http://people.duke.edu/~ccc14/sta-663-2017/)
  
  The goal of STA 663 is to learn statistical programming - how to write code to solve statistical problems. In general, statistical problems have to do with the estimation of some characteristic derived from data - this can be a point estimate, an interval, or an entire function. Almost always, solving such statistical problems involves writing code to collect, organize, explore, analyze and present the data. For obvious reasons, we would like to write good code that is readable, correct and efficient, preferably without reinventing the wheel.

  This course is made by EMBL, which covers moden statistic knowledge, machine learning, handson, etc.

- Python Data Science Handbook [Github] (https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)
  
  This is a book about doing data science with Python, which immediately begs the question: what is data science? It's a surprisingly hard definition to nail down, especially given how ubiquitous the term has become. Vocal critics have variously dismissed the term as a superfluous label (after all, what science doesn't involve data?) or a simple buzzword that only exists to salt resumes and catch the eye of overzealous tech recruiters.
