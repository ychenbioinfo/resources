* Computational Statisics in Python STA 663 (Duke University) http://people.duke.edu/~ccc14/sta-663-2017/
  
  The goal of STA 663 is to learn statistical programming - how to write code to solve statistical problems. In general, statistical problems have to do with the estimation of some characteristic derived from data - this can be a point estimate, an interval, or an entire function. Almost always, solving such statistical problems involves writing code to collect, organize, explore, analyze and present the data. For obvious reasons, we would like to write good code that is readable, correct and efficient, preferably without reinventing the wheel.
